// add folder called Router/AppRouter and past all the code except import part to AppRouter
// define a func AppRouter and render it from App.js
//Create 6 new files for the 6 components
// setup impots, component, default export
// import into AppRouter so they can be used

// add props as an argument to edit page to show that many information exist there

// remove editExpencePage from header file because it has dynamic address

//react-routing only pass PROPS to components that used inside of the route --> Headre can not access to the props because was not setup as a component value for the route
